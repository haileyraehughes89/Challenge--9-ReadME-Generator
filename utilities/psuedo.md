## User Story

```md
AS A developer
I WANT a README generator
SO THAT I can quickly create a professional README for a new project
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
WHEN I am prompted for information about my application repository
THEN a high-quality, professional README.md is generated with the title of my project and sections entitled Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions
WHEN I enter my project title
THEN this is displayed as the title of the README
WHEN I enter a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions
THEN this information is added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests
WHEN I choose a license for my application from a list of options
THEN a badge for that license is added near the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled License that explains which license the application is covered under
WHEN I enter my GitHub username
THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with a link to my GitHub profile
WHEN I enter my email address
THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with instructions on how to reach me with additional questions
WHEN I click on the links in the Table of Contents
THEN I am taken to the corresponding section of the README

HAILEY FOCUS:
my goal right now is to make a list of licenses
partner one: I DONT NEED TO MAKE A MESSAGE RIGHT NOW. I JUST NEED TO MAKE A LIST OF CONSTANTS THAT WILL TIE THE LICENSE INFORMATION TO THE TYPE OF LICENSE. GOOOOOODDAMMIT.
I need the names of those licenses to populate in a list array in another document
partner one: OK I MADE THE FUCKING LIST
partner two: cool... I still need access to that fucking list
I need to make a THERAPIST to get these two to TALK to each other
Therapist: ...ok. We are in the same room. that's a good start (made file to start conversation).
Now, let's try a short cut. can I just link the array?
wow... that worked

    RELATIONSHIP SAVED
